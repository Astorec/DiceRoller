# DiceRoller

This was a project I started a few Years ago to get used to working with C++ as I was going to try and learn how to use Unreal Engine. Though in the end I abanoded it to learn C#.

Probably will pick this up again to see if I can update it a bit some better programing practices I've learnt in recent times
